## Background
Before commencing my graduate certificate program in Machine Learning at the University of Florida, I sought to develop an AI application using OpenAI technology. After thorough research, I chose React as the framework for this project.

## Approach
Having gained practical experience with React, my next step was to integrate OpenAI's API into the application.

## Results
The resulting application allows users to upload an image and pose questions about it. The responses are generated by OpenAI's API, enabling a dynamic and interactive user experience. Users can continue asking questions or upload a new image to inquire about different content

## Next Steps
Upon completing this initial project, I am inspired to create a comprehensive application that combines chatbot functionality, image analysis, and photo generation capabilities.
