## Background
As someone who specializes in Javascript, I wanted to start getting my feet wet in python. I created some practice projects to learn some basic skills.

## Approach
I took inspiration from the python course I took in college, and made similar projects that are easy to understand for beginners.

## Results
There are 6 different projects, including printing lines, reading files, and performing math operations based on input. 

## Next Steps
