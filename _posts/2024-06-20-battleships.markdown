## Background
As a seasoned software engineer specializing in Javascript, I sought opportunities to explore engaging coding projects. Motivated by the desire to expand my portfolio, I embarked on developing a classic childhood game: Battleship.

## Approach
I aimed to design a streamlined project, emphasizing future adaptability and scalability. This involved methodically breaking down each step and meticulously coding the desired functionalities for my game.

## Results
In this project, I successfully implemented a fully functional Battleship game where users can strategically place their ships and commence gameplay. The game alternates turns between the user and the computer, progressing until one side successfully sinks all opposing ships, demonstrating a seamless gameplay experience.

## Next Steps
Moving forward, several enhancements are planned for this game. Firstly, I intend to elevate the design by refining the styling to closely mirror the original game's aesthetic. Additionally, I aim to enhance the computer's gameplay logic; currently random, I plan to introduce basic algorithms that guide the computer's moves, particularly focusing on selecting spaces adjacent to hits, akin to human-like strategy. Ultimately, the overarching goal is to evolve this project into a multiplayer experience.
