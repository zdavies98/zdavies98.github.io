## Background
In seeking to deepen my understanding of React, I embarked on a project to develop a straightforward yet engaging application. I chose to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game, which provided a practical introduction to React and allowed me to gain hands-on experience with its core concepts and functionalities

## Approach
I began by thoroughly reviewing the documentation on setting up a React project. Following this, I delved into additional documentation to understand and implement the necessary React functionality for the game.

## Results
I successfully developed a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in React, incorporating features such as alternating turns between X and O and accurately declaring a winner.

## Next Steps
The next steps for this project would involve updating the design, implementing a tie scenario, and adding multiplayer functionality. However, I believe it would be more beneficial to invest my time in a new React project, as this game is quite elementary.
