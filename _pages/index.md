I am a Software Engineer with nearly 4 years experience. I graduated from the University of South Florida in December 2020 with a Bachelor's of Science in Cybersecurity.
My passion for software development has been growing exponentially since the start of college, and with the rise in Artificial Intelligence, I am pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Machine Learning from the University of Florida starting in the Fall of 2024. Upon completion of this certificate, I plan to further my education by attending some sort of Artificial Intelligence Master's Degree Program.
